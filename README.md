# KeyboardShortcuts

"When I was a kid, we had to type up hill both ways..."

I was feeling a bit nostalgic for the old WordPerfect Function key templates, so I put this together. I tried to stay true to the feel of the originals. "for IBM Personal Computers"

## Why Html? ##
I decided to use HTML for the page layout so that I could use Version Control Magic with decent diffs. It also gave me a chance to dig into some css fun.

## A request ##
Please contribute your changes or modifications back to this project. I'll accept pull requests!

I'd like to build these for a few different programs, and also for nonstandard keyboard layouts.
